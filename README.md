# Squids Pro Quo

🐙 💯

## Better Datetime (css)

Puts the correct headings above the each dropdown in a datetime, and puts the fields next to each other instead of on top of each other.

## Conditional Form Sections (js)

Notes:

1. Add `#` followed by a number at the start of a section name to give a section an identifying number. The section will be hidden by default
2. Add `?` followed by the section number to the start of the radio button name for the section that you want the radio button to show

- Only use this for 1-page forms
- Don't have a default value on your radio buttons
- Don't have any 'required' fields inside conditional sections

## Layout of 'Field Notes'

Fix 'File Note' / form helper text weirdly spaced in same line as question title
